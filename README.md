# README
 House Hunter app.

### BUILT WITH:
- Rails version 5.0.2
- Ruby version 2.4.0

### PURPOSE:

This Web app was created because of an assignment for The Iron Yard and was originally built over the course of one weekend, more features were added later on. The initial goal was to use Rails framework to design and build our own version of a real estate site in the vein of Zillow or Trulia from the ground up. It started with a static HTML design of our choice and then using Rails making everything functional.


### FEATURES:
- Omniauth gem for Github authentication.
- Create, edit, and delete homes with user based parameters.
- Search function AJAX enabled for dynamic searching.
- Informs people how long ago homes were posted.
- Kaminari gem for pagination.
- Ability to view different sized pictures of the homes via modals with the help of jquery, bootstrap, and the     shrine gem.
- Ability to favorite a home by clicking on a heart glyph. Favoriting is tracked and related to the users.
- Emails are sent out upon signup, if a home is favorited by another user, and a Weekly Newsletter.
